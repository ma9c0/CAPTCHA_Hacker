This is so far just a general outline and idea.

## Basic outline of this project
The main idea is to allow machine read text based on the content with a tone, such as excited, happy, sad, angry, and so on. By providing a text, with context, preferably, outputting a voice with appropriate tone. At the end, may be trying to create a simple website to launch it. 
## How am I thinking about building it
The dataset that I am thinking is to crop faces from movies, and by using CV to capture faces and read their emotions. After that, by matching their emotions with the lines they are speaking, learn and generate a model based on general gender. I am assuming the tone of any emotion is the same for whatever gender. 
## Potential of this project
Instead of hearing from AI, such as ChatGPT and Grok, hearing it with emotions would make it sound more like human. The idea is kind of stupid, but it is using what I want to learn and enhance. 

## Timeline and structures

### Find dataset
### Find research and structures or existing models to capture faces with emotions
### Construct dataset with matching emotions and lines
